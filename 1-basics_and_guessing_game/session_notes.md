## Session Notes

(raw text dump)

Nate:
Python
* Interpreted vs.  compiled
    * Python is both 
* Duck typed
    * Not strongly typed until compiled?
* Implicitly typed
* Snake case, not camel case:
    * snake_case not camelCase
Basic Functions:
print() 
* MUST use a string - print
Imaginary numbers:
* Use a “j” for the imaginary part - z = 4j 
* Squaring is easy! **
Strings:
* Strings are iterable!
* a.strip()   Ditch whitespace
* Len(),  a.upper(), a.lower() 
* a.replace(“H”,”J”).     # replace all 
* a.split().   Split string to list
* x = input(), or x = input(“Hey oh, gimme some input”)
* Casting - forcing type on a variable
    * via str( ), int( )
    * i.e. print
* Can use else in a for loop!
    * Like a finally,  prints at end of for
