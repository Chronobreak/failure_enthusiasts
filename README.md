Welcome everyone! 

Our code base lives here - session notes, setup files for projects, and projects themselves (later). I'll add a folder each week, to keep this central and easy to access.

**If this is your first time, navigate to the `python101-environment-setup` folder here on Github and follow the setup instructions.**

Happy Failing!
